# rfs

yet another file system running on FUSE. Just for fun :)


## How to guide

Why bootstrap yet another toy filesystem, because finished research on gramine procted_fs module. Hence start a new project to practice rust programming is really fun. But due to the lack of linux kernel driver decelopment knowledge, I could only implement a file system working on FUSE, 233333.
